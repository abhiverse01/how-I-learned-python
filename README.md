# This repository contains a colab notebook entitled "how-I-learned-python".
# It contains all the code snippets, resources links, details that I used while learning to code.
# I've compiled this Colab Notebook so that, anyone starting to learn coding with Python, they can follow this notebook.
# I believe it can work as an excellent resource.
# I've promised myself to constantly to continuously update this repo with all the newly explored concepts.

# Keep Learning!!!
# Keep Coding!!!
